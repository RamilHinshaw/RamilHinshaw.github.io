description: Derp the game is an amazing game made in 2017 for the fake game jam that doesn't exist. This is just a template for the games discription so don't take this to seriously. I could use lorem ipsum but this is more fun. Welp I need more lines so the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Polybrew
================

![Picture](/img/projects/polybrew/2.png)
This is a game that Darkninja are I are currently working on. It is a game that allows you create various potions with different ingredients. You can cut (knife), smash (Pestle), and cook (oven) causing the ingredients to have various effects when put into the pot.

NPC's would come and request a type of potion they want. There needs depend on their occupation and the attributes associated with it. For example an assassin would come and may want to coat his arrows in something non lethal to capture his target. The player would give something like a paralysis, or sleeping potion opposed to using poison.

The game is still in its early beta stages but progress how been made with it constantly. Hopefully it will see the day of light.
