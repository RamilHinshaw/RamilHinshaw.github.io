description: Derp the game is an amazing game made in 2017 for the fake game jam that doesn't exist. This is just a template for the games discription so don't take this to seriously. I could use lorem ipsum but this is more fun. Welp I need more lines so the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Character Customization
================

###Blendshape testing with my own custom models :)
This is my project to test blendshapes with sliders. I create a tutorial video on how to do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypRhJAfJXAc Everything in this game was done by scratch. I 3D modeled and textured the characters, houses, etc. The white mark there just represents there is an empty slot I can use for accessories like glasses or jewelry.

Here you can see the face change based on the slider. The white mark on the forehead is just a placeholder showing its an empty slot for item/accessories (like earrings, glasses, and what not)

Made a lot of different characters as a result, haven't done much with this project. Hope I can come back to this in the future.
