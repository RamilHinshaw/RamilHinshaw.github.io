description: This was a project that was worked with a team for the Big Ocean Button Challenge. My Job was to work on the front end of the app and I could use whatever tools I needed to do the job. I chose to work with React Native with my familiarity with Html and Css. It was very challenging and was my first app but I am happy I took up the challenge to learn something new.

This app was made for the Big Ocean [Button Challenge](https://herox.com/bigoceanbutton) along with 3 other members.
I was tasked with the front-end design of the project and used React Native for the cross platform support along with the familiar css styling.
