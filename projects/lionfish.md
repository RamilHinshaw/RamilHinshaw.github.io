description: Derp the game is an amazing game made in 2017 for the fake game jam that doesn't exist. This is just a template for the games discription so don't take this to seriously. I could use lorem ipsum but this is more fun. Welp I need more lines so the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
