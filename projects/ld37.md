description: Derp the game is an amazing game made in 2017 for the fake game jam that doesn't exist. This is just a template for the games discription so don't take this to seriously. I could use lorem ipsum but this is more fun. Welp I need more lines so the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Ludum Dare 37:  The RPG Game
================

![Picture](/img/projects/ld37/1.png)
Here comes another Ludam Dare :) . This is a project I worked on for the Ludum Dare 37 with the theme of "One Room". Here it is a management game where you buy and put things on the tables to sell your goods at higher prices from the supplier :P

I unfortunately didn't go through my entire list of ToDo's: http://pastebin.com/A79gSzT1 There were no animations added, and there where a lot of features programmed (personalites, occupaction, age, ect) that was not in the final build. But that is the nature of programming in ludum dare.

But it works quite well (aside from the web version), just doesn't have an end goal, but still a fun concept.

From this Ludam Dare, I've learned a very important lesson. Don't spend time planning for most of the jam (woops) and don't write useless unwanted code. I've programmed a lot of things for the AI that didn't get used. I need to prioritize the base game then add all the goodies later.
