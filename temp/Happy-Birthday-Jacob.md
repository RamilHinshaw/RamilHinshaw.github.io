Happy Birthday Jacob! I hope you didn't think I would miss something as important as your birthday. Because that is far from the truth. I don't need a facebook to tell me its your birthday (so hopefully its your birthday today or this will be very awkward)

You see, this idiot friend of yours decided not to was too lazy to create a birthday card (like any sane person would) so instead I decided to finally created that website I promised you. And lets just say a week was not enough for my terrible html skills haha but was well worth it. Now I have something worth showing :D

Its not mobile friendly at the moment but hey, who uses phones anyways :)

Once I finish the media query apocalypse I will give the jekyll source. I tried to finish it today but alas time is not infinite.

And whenever we meet an real life I'll give you my real present >:)

But enough about me! You're now [insert age here] old wow! And you're a graduate!? *gasp* If you need need an ear to talk to or a shoulder to lean on remember don't forget this other friend of yours ;) I'll always support you from the deep web *cue omnious sound effects* or I can just help you in person haha. 

Welp thats all I can say but good luck with your life's endeavors and may we continue being best friends Sir Mr. Level Hyrulian 42 Jacob Hobbie -chan ~desu!
